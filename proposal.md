Hi!

I'm very interested in the project `Release engineering: add Kubescape to commonly requested package managers`. The project will also benefit me greatly, as I have few experiences working with golang and cloud-native applications. This project can help me strengthen my DevOps skills related to golang applications and learn more about release engineering. I already have some packaging experience for applications in other languages. I also have experience in GitHub Actions.

I have also completed my initial investigation, and here is my proposal.

I have tried packaging both the rpm and the Debian packages for demoing by using the binary from `kubescape-ubuntu-latest.tar.gz` and building directly from the source code. Here is the [packaging scripts' source code](https://github.com/HollowMan6/kubescape-deb-rpm). I have packed the auto-completion for bash, zsh and fish besides the main program. In addition, I have added a test to ensure that the binary we built during the packaging process can run and have the correct version with git enabled in the build. I have also written a GitHub Actions workflow for automating the whole process with both rpm and deb in both amd64 and arm64 (so [issue #195](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/issues/195) will also get resolved). You can get the build artifacts [from binary directly](https://github.com/HollowMan6/kubescape-deb-rpm/actions/runs/4143706022) and [from source code](https://github.com/HollowMan6/kubescape-deb-rpm/actions/runs/4176938437).

For distributing the packages, of course, we can build that manually, just like [one of my previous projects](https://github.com/openSUSE/Customize-IBus/tree/package-repo). However, I highly recommend openSUSE's open build service (OBS). I have also [created a demo](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:hollowman/kubescape). OBS allows easy distribution of the packages. Users can add a repository according to the [guide here](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Ahollowman&package=kubescape). The Linux package manager in their system will ensure that users can get the update quickly. One thing to note is that OBS doesn't support Internet connections when building, so it can't fetch dependencies directly from the Internet. As a result, I pre-fetch the dependencies and used golang vendor build mode to resolve the dependencies issue. Now OBS supports operating systems such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Mageia, openSUSE, and SLE, with architectures like x86_64, aarch64, i586, s390x, armv6l, armv7l, and ppc64le. What is more, I have also uploaded the packages to [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~hollowman86/+archive/ubuntu/kubescape), so users can easily configure the repository for Ubuntu's package manager.

The work I would do during the mentorship will include adding more tests to ensure the packaging is OK. I would also integrate the OBS repository update feature (automate `osc addremove *; osc commit`) into the workflow. Finally, I will integrate the [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/HollowMan6/kubescape-deb-rpm/blob/main/.github/workflows) into the release workflow of kubescape.

During the demoing period, I have also tried [bumping from version 2.1.3 to version 2.2.0](https://github.com/HollowMan6/mdbook-pdf/commit/1eefcb6aa9464d7fa842912cee7d98acd5025bfb), so I know what I will make to update automatically once the release workflow is ready.

I have already submitted [PR #1095](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/pull/1095) and [PR #1105](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/pull/1105) to fix some minor errors. Suppose the task finishes in advance of the project deadline, and there is still enough time remaining. In that case, I will look into making other improvements to the release engineering process for Kubescape, as well as applying similar rigour to platforms such as Nix, krew, and our client container (used by a GitHub action to run Kubescape). I'm also giving my promise that I will continue contributing at Kubescape even after the project has ended.

Best regards,

Songlin
